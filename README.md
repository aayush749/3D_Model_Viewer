# 3D Model Viewer
This is a 3D model viewer in which you can import 3D models in obj file format and view them

# Steps to build
This project is made using Visual Studio 2019. So you would need Visual Studio to build and run the project (any older version like VS2013 onwards should work fine, although I've not tested them). 

**Step - 1**: run 'git clone git@github.com:aayush749/3D_Model_Viewer.git'.

**Step - 2**: after the previous operation completes. Double click on the Solution (.sln) file, or open a project using Visual Studio and locate the Solution file.

**Step - 3**: Once Visual Studio loads the project, make sure you are building under x86 CPU architecture (and Debug/Release build doesn't really matter), and hit Build (or Ctrl + Shift + B).

**Step - 4**: After the build process completes, launch it from Visual Studio by pressing F5.
